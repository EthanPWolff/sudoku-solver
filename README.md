# Sudoku Solver
A solver for sudoku puzzles implemented with JavaScript using the p5.js library for the GUI.\

## How it works
It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to test possible puzzles and backtrack when\
a puzzle is incorrect, until it eventually generates the correct puzzle.

## How to use
Go to https://ethanpwolff.github.io/sudoku-solver/ to test it out for yourself!\
Click on a cell to select it, and then press a key from 0-9 to place it in that\
cell. You can then press Enter to solve and Space to reset the puzzle.
